    "# Understanding RNN\n",
    "RNNs accept an input vector `x` and returns output vector `y` based on the currect input as well as all its lagged values . In doing so, RNN essentailly maintains internally a state that gets updated everytime RNN block gets called. In the simplest form, this state consists of a *hidden vector* `h`. Below is implementation of a Vanilla RNN class (credits: [Andrej Karpath](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/))"
